# A-RAG Evaluation Lane Orchestrator State (Archived Bootstrap Snapshot)

> This file is retained for historical context only.
> It captured **initial lane bootstrapping before run-level evidence was produced**.

- Snapshot timestamp (EST): 2026-02-21 21:28
- Captured state at snapshot time: `UNKNOWN` / incomplete evidence

## Canonical current-state sources (use these instead)
For the adjudicated run:
- `governance/evaluation-inputs/run-20260221-212859-est/03_governance/orchestrator/orchestrator-final-state.md`
- `governance/evaluation-inputs/run-20260221-212859-est/03_governance/gate/final-gate-decision.md`
- `governance/evaluation-inputs/run-20260221-212859-est/03_governance/comparison/verdict.json`

## Why archived
Leaving the old bootstrap checklist as active status caused stale contradictions once run evidence was populated. Current governance status must come from run-scoped artifacts.
